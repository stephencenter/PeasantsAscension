How to play:

	SETUP:
		1. Find the folder named "Game Files"
		2. Run the file named "PythoniusRPG.exe" in this folder
		3. Play the game
		
	PLAYING THE GAME:
		Pythonius RPG is very simple. After creating a character,
		you are placed on the world map with minimal equipment. 
		To use a command, type in the command and then hit 
		Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OSX) to send it. 
		Available commands are (almost) always listed on the 
		screen, and can often be shortened to just the first 
		letter (i.e. "x" or "e" instead of "exit"). Sometimes,
		such as on the title screen, the command is listed as 
		a word with the first letter in brackets (i.e. "[P]lay").
		In this case, just input the letter inside the brackets.
		Other times, the command is simply a number with the 
		command located next to it. (i.e. [1] View Inventory).
		Simply input the number in the brackets next to the 
		command you want to use.
----------------------------------------------------
What to do if the game crashes:
	Due to how the Windows Command Prompt and Python work, errors
	raised through the console immediately close the game, preventing
	the error message from being read. To counteract this, the game
	automatically logs the error in a file named "error_log.out". If 
	you encounter an error, the message will be located there, and the 
	file can be sent to me (ninjafurret@gmail.com) so I can fix the 
	problem. Don't worry, the only information located in the file is
	a generic error message and nothing else. (If you want to verify 
	this, you can open the file using a program like Notepad, Notepad++, 
	or Sublime Text.) I appreciate your help!
----------------------------------------------------
How to change the settings:
	By default, the game saves its files in a folder called "Save Files",
	located in the Game Files directory. It also defaults to playing all
	music/sound-effects at full volume. These can both be changed by 
	editing a set of variables in a file called "settings.cfg", located in
	the "PythoniusRPG" folder. This file can be opened using a program like
	Notepad, Notepad++, or Sublime Text. Instructions on changing these
	are located in the file.
