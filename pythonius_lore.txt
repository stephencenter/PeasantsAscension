    PythoniusRPG takes place on Earth in an alternate reality. In this reality, an
eight continent exists known as Arcadia, located in the southern Pacific Ocean.
This continent was a safe-haven for non-human intelligent life, as it was the only
place in the world that contained nations that didn't persecute them. Among these
intelligent life-forms are Flyscors, a bipedal reptilian species capable of flight
which inhabit the nations of Flyscoria; elves and dwarves, which mainly 
occupy Pythonia, Elysium, and Chin'tor; and
