RPG Progress Log:
•Weapons now have elements assigned to them. Different elements are weak/resistant/neutral to certain other ones. The order of weaknesses are: Fire<Water<Electric<Earth<Grass<Wind<Ice<Fire, while “None” is neutral to everything. At the moment, this mainly just affects player attacks, but is planned to affect enemy ones too in the future. (v0.0.50)

•Monsters are now assigned different elements based on where they are, and therefore now actually drop the correct items. (v0.0.49)

•Monsters can now drop rare items depending on which area they are in. For example, Yetis and Arctic Wolves can drop Ice Swords, while Minor Ents can drop an Enchanted Wood Wand. (v0.0.48)

•Numerous flaws with the battle system have been fixed. For instance, you now always deal at least 1 damage, to avoid triggering an error message trying to find the square-root of a negative number. (v0.0.47)

•The inventory system has been cleaned up to look better when using it, and equipping items is now easier to do. Monsters can now drop certain items after battle. (v0.0.46)

•There are now three more Damaging Spells, and 6 more Buff spells. The yes/no detecting now works slightly better. Consumable items can no longer have multiple uses. No items actually took advantage of the multiple uses, so it doesn't really change anything. (v0.0.44)
