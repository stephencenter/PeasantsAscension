PEASANT-RPG GOALS

-- 1.00 update plans -- 
[x] Add several new monster items

[x] Rewrite the monster attack function by seperating the damage formula from the AI

[x] Make a standardized "Unit" class that the Monster and PlayableCharacter classes will inherit from

[x] Move all PCU and Monster information to a new units.py file

[x] Rework the entire world.py file, parts of the towns.py file, and some dialogue from the npcs.py file to use a custom tile-based world system

[x] Rework monster leveling to be specific to each tile instead of based off a scaling distance formula

[x] Rework a lot of the code to be more modular, so that the game can function as a Game Engine

[x] Rework the battle system so that it supports multiple enemies.

[x] Rework magic so that it doesn't always go first in battle. This would be a much-needed nerf to mages.

[x] Create a `colorize()` function using colorama
	[x] instead of `Fore.RED + 'string' + Fore.RESET`, use `colorize(string, 'red')`

[x] Rework Conversations and Quests to be cleaner and more functional

[x] Fix the drop system at the end of battle to work better with the multi-monster battle system.

[x] Separate PCU/Monster element attributes into an offensive (off_element) and defensive (def_element) element. 
	[x] This is similar to what was previously in the game, where weapons could have their own unique element. 
		The main difference is that this will be significantly easier to work with.
		
[x] Revamp saving
	[x] Creating a character should immediately save the game, so that if you decide to quit before you get to a town, you can still 
		reload your game.
	[x] Create a save_load.py file that handles saving and loading the game to help clear out the main.py file
	[x] When you save the game, the save files should first be placed into a temp folder instead of immediately overwriting the originals. 
		This would prevent bugs from accidentally corrupting a save file.
	[x] Make the game generate a .txt file containing a disclaimer about manually editing save files. 
	
[x] Rename NPCClass to npcs, rename npcs to dialogue. Move all NPC stuff to npcs, move all dialogue stuff to dialogue.

[ ] Completely rework the world and the plot
	[ ] Redo the world:
		[ ] The whole "nation divided into regions, each comprised of a single biome" thing is really stupid. 
			Instead, the world should be more natural, with caves and mountain ranges spread all across instead
			of only in a single region.
		[ ] Make the game world WAY smaller. There's simply not enough content that you can squeeze into a massive 60,000-tile game using
			only text.
		[ ] "Illusory Forest" - An expy of Zelda's Lost Woods, but with the SWENSEN mechanic from RuneScape
		[ ] "The Overshire Graveyard" - A port of the graveyard from the coordinate-based Pythonius, this one could have some 
			really cool features in it thanks to the new system
		[ ] Caves
			[ ] Would have their own unique enemies and music. 
			[ ] The first cave (Barrier Cave) would separate the Central Forest from the rest of the continent, making entering it required to 
				progress in the game.
				[ ] Would function as a sort of  "natural barrier", or a "beef-gate", with higher-level enemies in it that disuade the player from 
					entering before they are ready
		[ ] Add a couple dozen houses and chests.
		[ ] Rename a couple of the goofier towns and npcs
		[ ] Personally, I think that the world would be better suited as an large nation-continent/island surrounded by
			ocean on a planet called Arcadia, instead of a single nation in a continent on earth. It's really weird for a country to have
			deserts, tundra, mountains, forests, etc... while simultaneously being just south of the equator and surrounded by other countries
			with much more normal geography. 
		[ ] The regions should be renamed (again...) to be more province-like
		[ ] Thex is now a Harconian province instead of a separate nation
		[ ] Retcon the whole "democratically elected leader" thing. It sounds good and is a good way to make your country likable but I feel
			it's harder to work with in a fantasy setting without a concept of heirs and inheritence.
		[ ] 12 Provinces:
			[ ] Overshire
			[ ] Celemia
			[ ] Simphet
			[ ] Thex
			[ ] Camberlite
			[ ] Kohrin
			[ ] Pelamora
			[ ] Flute
			[ ] Deltora
			[ ] Downpour
			[ ] Chin'tor
			[ ] Whitlock
			
	[ ] Redo the plot:
		[ ] Beginning your adventure:
			"""[Name] wakes up under a tree, a tree they fall to sleep under every night.
			    They stare in awe at the beautiful scenery, despite having seen it every 
			    day of their life. [Name] has lived in the island-nation of Harconia their
			    entire life, as has every other inhabitant of the island. The oceans of 
			    Arcadia are much too trecherous to navigate, and nobody has survived more 
			    than a few minutes sailing across it. Despite having the entire island of
				Harconia to explore, [Name] has never explored more than a few miles from
				this tree. But today is different. [Name] feels like going on an adventure.
				And so the adventure began."""
				
			[ ] Alternatively:
				"""[Name] awakes under a tree in the Central Forest, a small forested area
				in the province of Parriwey. Parriwey is just one of a dozen provinces in the
				Island-Nation of Harconia, a large island that may be the only continent 
				the world of Arcadia has to offer. Or perhaps there is more, no one knows.
				The Arcadian oceans are much too dangerous to check. "Why are the oceans so
				trecherous?" [Name] wonders. Sitting under this tree certainly isn't going to
				give [Name] any answers. And so they set off on their adventure."""
			 
		[ ] Since the game takes place in a world where the oceans are FAR too trecherous to possibly explore, no other continents or islands
			are known to exist. Because of this, the first people that somehow made it to Harconia and discovered it are known as the "Forefathers",
			and the unknown place they came from is called "The Far-off Land".
		[ ] The war with Thex is now a civil war (as Thex is now a Harconian Province instead of a separate country)
		[ ] BIG TWIST: The princess isn't alive anymore. In fact, she's never been alive - King Harconius II has no heir. Princess Celeste
			and her supposed death is simply a coverup to justify starting a civil war with Thex. King Harconius II is extremely paranoid - his wife
			is pregnant with his daughter (to be named Celeste) and the King fears that Thex is plotting to assassinate him and his wife in
			an attempt to ursurp the throne. In addition, the King was the one that put up the barrier around Thex, again, because he was paranoid.
		[ ] When you discover this fact and confront the King about it, he denies it. When he sees you aren't falling for his lies, he orders his
			Royal Guard to kill you. These guards, of course, were unaware of the King's trechery and viewed your party as heroes, and refuse to 
			attack you. The King realizes he has to take matters into his own hands, casting lightning magic to kill his guards, and then finally
			turning to you. The King turns to your party and the final boss battle begins.
		[ ] Killing the King reveals that the Royal Family's Lightning/Storm magic has unknowingly caused the extremely dangerous and unnavigable oceans.
			When he dies, his scepter falls to the floor, shattering into pieces. The castle begins crumbling, and after escaping along with everyone inside,
			it is revealed that the a new era of exploration and prosperity begin.

[ ] Fix resting - at the moment I'm pretty sure it doesn't even heal you

[ ] Support for multiple status effects, including mundane things like "Alive" or "Disarmed"

[ ] Automatic attack redirection if target unit dies before attack goes off

[ ] Make it so Potions can be used on allies, and make items wait until the user's turn to actually go off

[ ] Add abilities that can be used in battle, and add a new Ability class.
	[ ] Each class will have their own set of four unique abilities, each of which will scale with their "main attribute".
		(PER for Rangers, WIS for Paladins, etc.)
	[x] Add Action Points (AP). Every class has a base AP of 10, and it cannot be increased through leveling.
		Instead, AP is gained via equipping new accessories called "Action Items". Each tier of action item gives 5 more AP than the last, so 5/10/15/20...
		[ ] Ranger, Quiver
		[ ] Warrior, Shield
		[ ] Paladin, Cross Necklace
		[ ] Monk, Meditation Candles
		[ ] Assassin, Poisons (nightshade, etc)
		[ ] Mage, Runestones
		
[ ] Add a second Accessory slot, called an "Action Slot"

[ ] Alchemy
	[ ] Buy an "Pocket Alchemy Lab" and use it to bring up the Alchemy menu
	[ ] In this menu, all items in your inventory tagged as alchemy ingredients (i.e. miscellaneous items dropped by enemies)
	    will show up. Select any three of them to make a potion. 
	[ ] Each ingredient has a specific "flavor", meaning that it can be used to make a certain kind of potion.
	    When you select your ingredients, the game uses RNG to determine what kind of potion it should be.
		Use three ingredients each with different flavors, and there's a 33.33% chance for the potion to end up as each flavor.
		Use two ingredients of the same flavor, and one of a different flavor, and there's a 66.67% and 33.33% chance respectively.
		etc.
	[ ] These potions can be used to do various things. Some of them are mundane, doing things as simple as curing status ailments
		restoring HP/MP, or increasing stats in-battle. But others have cooler effects, such as allowing you to rename your character,
		and enabling you to re-pick your class. 

[ ] Color "important" text using Colorama
	[x] Attribute scaling in ability descriptions
		[x] STR, red
		[x] DEX, green
		[x] INT, blue
		[x] PER, cyan
		[x] WIS, yellow
		[x] CON, magenta
	[x] Dead participants in battle, red
	[ ] Spell power, weapon damage, damage reduction, green
	[ ] Coordinates, town names, and NPC names, yellow
	[ ] (in battle) Health, green | action points, yellow | mana, blue
	[ ] Critical Strikes, red
	[ ] Damage values, blue

[ ] Boss descriptions - A paragraph of text that "sets the scene" for boss battles. Eerie music plays during this time.

[ ] Clean up the coordinate inventory system
	
[ ] Fix all of the quests that have been broken due to all the above changes

[ ] Rework the Divining Rod and the Magic Compass to be compatible with the tile system:
	[ ] Make the Divining Rod tell whether or not there are any gems within the 9 tiles surrounding the player.
	[ ] Make the compass enable the coordinate system. Without it, you can write down coordinates in your inventory but cannot read them on the
		movement system menu.
		
[ ] Before v1.0.0 is release, the game NEEDS at least this:
	[ ] Every boss currenlty programmed placed somewhere on the map
	[ ] At least 3 main-storyline quests
	[ ] At least 3 sidequests
	[ ] At LEAST 7-8 towns placed somewhere on the map
	[ ] At LEAST all of the Central Forest tiles programmed, as well as possibly a bit of the shore at the edge of the
		Central Forest and maybe all of Barrier Cave
	
-- 1.1 update plans -- 
[ ] Add back in the Anti-Blood Squad, now that multi-monster battles are a thing. 

[ ] Add a gender select option (no gameplay effects)
	[ ] This would also require rewording a LOT of the game's text

[ ] Add races (Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, etc)
	[ ] These races would have a slight effect on the players stats
	[ ] Also add a PlayableCharacter.generate_lore() method that generates 2-3 pseudo-random paragraphs based on the player's gender, class, and race.
		The lore would be stored in a player_object.lore attribute, and would be viewable from the [P]arty section of the menu.

[ ] Add attribute training

[ ] Add a neat weather system.
	[ ] Weather has a 5% chance of occuring each time you enter a tile, and
		a 33% chance of stopping when you enter a tile. Tiles that are adjacent to other tiles that already have weather on them will instead have a 
		75% chance to have weather occur. Additionally, tiles that have had a specific whether pattern on it for more than 10 steps will go on "cooldown",
		and be unable to be affected by that whether pattern again for 5 steps. This will (hopefully) result in rare but large "weather islands" occuring.
	[ ] The weather would probably have no gameplay effects, but there could possibly be ascendant abilities that utilize it 
	[ ] Weather ideas
		[ ] Rain (all regions but the desert and tundra) 
		[ ] Snow (the tundra) 
		[ ] Wind (all regions)
		[ ] Sandstorms (desert only)
