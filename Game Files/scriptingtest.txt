Item drop formula
    Each item has a droprate in the form of a tuple with Item1 as item_id and Item2 as droprate.
    When a monster is killed, it rolls a 1d100. If the roll is above the droprate, the item is
    removed from the pool. Then the game will choose a random element from the remaining items.
