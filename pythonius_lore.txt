    PythoniusRPG takes place on Earth in an alternate reality. In this reality, an
eight continent exists known as Arcadia, located in the southern Pacific Ocean.
This continent was a safe-haven for non-human intelligent life, as it was the only
place in the world that contained nations that didn't persecute them. 

Races found in Arcadia:
	-Flyscors: Bipedal reptilians capable of flight that inhabit Flyscoria
	-Elves and Dwarves: Humanoids that mainly occupy Pythonia, Elysium, and Chin'tor
	-Avalis: Humanoid creatures that are one third reptile, bird, and mammal, and can
found in small numbers all across Arcadia
	-Nagas: Half-humanoid half-serpent creatures. While many of these creatures are
seemingly unintelligent and hostile, a great number of them are quite the opposite.
They are native to Tao and Crystal Coast.
	-Gnomes: Humanoids of smaller stature that are often skilled in magic. They
make up the vast majority of the population of Montopeme.
	-Orcs: Unintelligent brutes with large physical prowess. They are humanoids, and can
be found in large numbers in Hillsbrad and Moroland.
	-Humans: You already know what these are, hopefully. They are generally only found
in the nations of Maranon and Durcuba.
	-Halflings: Very short humanoids with impressive agility. They are native to the
island of Thex.

The regions of Pythonia are named after the geography of the areas. While the
Monarchy of Pythonia has given each region an official title, the inhabitants of these
areas generally just refer to them using the names of their biomes.

Colloquial terms for the regions:
	-The Overshire Graveyard --> The Graveyard
	-The Pythonian Coastline --> The Shore
	-The Terrius Mt. Range ----> The Mountains
	-The Arcadian Desert ------> The Desert
	-The Central Forest -------> The Forest
	-The Bogthorn Marsh -------> The Swamp
	-The Glacian Plains -------> The Tundra


Pythonia has had many Monarchs over the years.

List of Monarchs w/ their period of reign:
	-King Pythonius I --> 451 A.D. to 516 A.D.
	-King Tapret I -----> 516 A.D. to 573 A.D.
	-Queen Victoria I --> 573 A.D. to 654 A.D.
	-King Lazarus I ----> 654 A.D. to 718 A.D.
	
	From 718 A.D. to 892 A.D., Pythonia had no monarch. The various lords and ladies of
	each region handled things themselves, but eventually tension between the regions
	began rising, culminating in the Pythonian Civil War from 893 to 901 A.D.
	Cesura, a brave paladin from the Central Forest, took command of the CF Army and 
	used his excellent leadership skills to reunite the Kingdom. After the war, he
	declared his hometown of Overshire as the capital of the Kingdom, and was elected
	as the new king. He was the first king to have not been a direct descendant of 
	Pythonius. His rule was marked by a transition to a more democratic government,
	and all monarchs were from here on elected by the people instead of being chosen
	by birthright.
	
	-King Cesura I -----> 901 A.D. to 956 A.D.
	-Queen Thanatrum I -> 956 A.D. to 958 A.D.
	
	Queen Thanatrum had the shortest reign of any Pythonian monarch. Merely a single year
	into her rule, she became sick with a strange disease. This disease was later identified
	and named "Hatchnuk's Blight" after the town that she was visiting when she contracted
	the illness. She, along with 35% of the Arcadian population, died from this horrible
	disease. Nowadays, this disease has been mostly eradicated except for one particularly 
	deadly and incurable strain which can only be found in the town of Hatchnuk.
	
	-King Pyravia I ----> 958 A.D. to 983 A.D.
	-King Tapret II ----> 983 A.D. to 1052 A.D.
	
	King Tapret II's rule was marked with incredible advancements in mathematics and 
	technology. He personally invested thousands of PP into helping introduce things
	that his predecessors had been neglecting, including running water, aqueducts, 
	sewer systems, and using brick/cobblestone roads instead of dirt/gravel. These are
	things that had been in use for several decades in most of the rest of Arcadia, but had
	failed to make it into Pythonia until King Tapret II funded it. As a result of his
	contributions, he is generally viewed as one of the best monarchs the nation had
	ever had, along with King Pythonius I and King Cesura I.
	
	-Queen Aristol I ---> 1052 A.D. to 1143 A.D.
	
	Queen Aristol I has the honor of being one of the longest reigning monarchs of Pythonia.
	Prior to her rule, the small island of Thex was a colony of Pythonia. Queen Aristol I
	allowed her subjects in the colony to vote on whether or not they wanted to become
	an independent nation. Thex had already been somewhat autonomous, and was generally not
	required to pay taxes to the Monarchy. The Thexians voted almost unanimously for the
	formation of a new nation, and Queen Aristol I transferred rule of the island to 
	King Thexus VII, a direct ancestor of the man that the island was named after.
	
	-King Pyravia II ---> 1143 A.D. to 1213 A.D.
	-King Harthis I ----> 1213 A.D. to 1290 A.D.
	-Queen Victoria II -> 1290 A.D. to 1351 A.D.
	-Queen Aristol II --> 1351 A.D. to 1403 A.D.
	-King Pythonius II -> 1403 A.D. to present (current as of 1407 A.D., the time of writing this)
	
	King Pythonius II is the current monarch of Pythonia. He is the first monarch to share his
	name with the famous war general, and is in fact a direct descendant of the original Pythonius.
	
Pythonian Langauge
	
	The official language of Pythonia is "Pythic" (pronounced pih-thick), a dialect of the Dai'ic 
	language used in Flyscoria. The two languages are nearly indistinguishable when spoken apart from
	minor pronunciation differences, but the two utilize entire different alphabets. The Pythic
	language uses the Elysian alphabet used in much of southern Arcadia, while Dai'ic uses the Latin
	alphabet that is standard in the northern countries of Arcadia.
