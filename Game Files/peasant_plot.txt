PEASANTS' ASCENSION PLOT:
    
    Peasants' Ascension takes place in the Kingdom of Harconia, the sole country
on the only continent on the planet of Arcadia. in the first year of the world, 
the Forefathers came from an unknown land and settled on the continent. Sometime
after this, the seas grew restless, and the oceans became completely impossible
to navigate. Covered in a thick fog, the Arcadian oceans hid away the rest of the
world, creating a watery barrier that prohibited exploration and stimied potential
growth of the Kingdom. 

	Despite this, the Kingdom of Harconia prospered. The first King, King Harconius,
united the people of the continent into 12 provinces, each of which had a distinct
culture and feel. For over 70 years Harconius ruled, with each year proving better 
than the last. After a brief succession crisis in the year 132, King Tapret became 
ruler, establishing a lineage that would begat Kings and Queens for centuries. A line 
of powerful, intelligent, and fair kings and queens followed Tapret's rule, and it
seemed that Harconia was in a Golden Age that would never end.

	In the year 709, King Halios II died after 58 years as reigning monarch. 
Her son, Harconius II took his place as the new king, and was the first one to 
share Harconius's name. It was not long, however, until disaster stuck the kingdom. 
Unbeknownst to the King, the province of Thex had been plotting a major attack 
on the rest of Kingdom. To do this, Thex organized a large group of spies
known as the "Thexus" and sent them to Harconia to scout the land. Harconia's army 
quickly put a stop to this, but the invaders still managed to do one thing that 
Harconia would have a hard time recovering from: They took King Harconius II's 
daughter hostage. Harconius was furious and immediately assembled a massive army 
to recover his beloved daughter and defeat the Thexian army.

    Despite having plenty of man-power, the Harconians were stopped dead in
their tracks. A magical shield had been placed over the island of Thex,
halting any chance of a possible incursion. Local mages and historians
attempted to identify the source of the magic and came to the conclusion
that the shield was coming from a large vein of Magestite that had recently
been uncovered along the coast of Thex. Magestite possessed magically resistant
that the Thexians had used to their advantage. All seemed lost until the Headmaster
of the Sorcerers' Guild mentioned a possible solution: Legend has it that
a lowly peasant from the town of Nearton would ascend to glory, and come to defeat
Harconia's enemies. That person would present themself to the King at a 
time when everything seemed hopeless, and would be holding a magical stone guarded 
by a terrifying monster in the Mountains of Harconia.

    You are this peasant. Find the stone and talk to the king. Save Harconius's
daughter and defeat the Thexians!
