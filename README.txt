How to play:

	SETUP:
		1. Find the folder named "Game Files"
		2. Run the file named "PythoniusRPG.exe" in this folder
		3. Play the game
		
	PLAYING THE GAME:
		Pythonius RPG is very simple. After creating a character,
		you are placed on the world map with minimal equipment. 
		To use a command, type in the command and then hit 
		Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OSX) to send it. 
		Available commands are (almost) always listed on the 
		screen, and can often be shortened to just the first 
		letter (i.e. "x" or "e" instead of "exit"). Sometimes,
		such as on the title screen, the command is listed as 
		a word with the first letter in brackets (i.e. "[P]lay").
		In this case, just input the letter inside the brackets.
		Other times, the command is simply a number with the 
		command located next to it. (i.e. [1] View Inventory).
		Simply input the number in the brackets next to the 
		command you want to use.
