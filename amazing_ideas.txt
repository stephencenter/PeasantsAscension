PEASANT-RPG GOALS

-- v1.0.0 update plans -- 
[x] Add several new monster items

[x] Rewrite the monster attack function by seperating the damage formula from the AI

[x] Make a standardized "Unit" class that the Monster and PlayableCharacter classes will inherit from

[x] Move all PCU and Monster information to a new units.py file

[x] Rework the entire world.py file, parts of the towns.py file, and some dialogue from the npcs.py file to use a custom tile-based world system

[x] Rework monster leveling to be specific to each tile instead of based off a scaling distance formula

[x] Rework a lot of the code to be more modular, so that the game can function as a Game Engine

[x] Rework the battle system so that it supports multiple enemies.

[x] Rework magic so that it doesn't always go first in battle. This would be a much-needed nerf to mages.

[x] Rework Conversations and Quests to be cleaner and more functional

[x] Fix the drop system at the end of battle to work better with the multi-monster battle system.

[x] Separate PCU/Monster element attributes into an offensive (off_element) and defensive (def_element) element. 
	[x] This is similar to what was previously in the game, where weapons could have their own unique element. 
		The main difference is that this will be significantly easier to work with.
		
[x] Revamp saving
	[x] Creating a character should immediately save the game, so that if you decide to quit before you get to a town, you can still 
		reload your game.
	[x] Create a save_load.py file that handles saving and loading the game to help clear out the main.py file
	[x] When you save the game, the save files should first be placed into a temp folder instead of immediately overwriting the originals. 
		This would prevent bugs from accidentally corrupting a save file.
	[x] Make the game generate a .txt file containing a disclaimer about manually editing save files. 
	
[x] Rename NPCClass to npcs, rename npcs to dialogue. Move all NPC stuff to npcs, move all dialogue stuff to dialogue.

[x] Fix resting - at the moment I'm pretty sure it doesn't even heal you

[x] Automatic attack redirection if target unit dies before attack goes off
		
[x] Revamp the inventory to show one instance of each item, with quantity to the right

[x] Make settings changable in-game

[x] Support for multiple status effects, including mundane things like "Alive" or "Disarmed"

[x] Redo all item descriptions to be multi-line

[x] Alchemy
	[x] Buy an "Pocket Alchemy Lab" and use it to bring up the Alchemy menu
	[x] In this menu, all items in your inventory tagged as alchemy ingredients (i.e. miscellaneous items dropped by enemies)
	    will show up. Select any three of them to make a potion. 
	[x] Each ingredient has a specific "flavor", meaning that it can be used to make a certain kind of potion.
	    When you select your ingredients, the game uses RNG to determine what kind of potion it should be.
		Use three ingredients each with different flavors, and there's a 33.33% chance for the potion to end up as each flavor.
		Use two ingredients of the same flavor, and one of a different flavor, and there's a 66.67% and 33.33% chance respectively.
		etc.
	[x] These potions can be used to do various things. Some of them are mundane, doing things as simple as curing status ailments
		restoring HP/MP, or increasing stats in-battle. But others have cooler effects, such as allowing you to rename your character,
		and enabling you to re-pick your class. 
		
[ ] Fix the tool items:
	[x] Fix the shovel
	[x] Fix the fast travel boots
	[x] Remove the Divining Rod
	[x] Remove the compass
	[ ] Add new item: Monster Encyclopedia - Identical to the Rangers' old "Scout" ability, without the crit bonus.
		Can only be used during battle.

[ ] Randomly Generated Dungeons
	[ ] Dungeons would be randomized mazes that are generated upon first entering them.
	[ ] Each province would have one dungeon that can be entered at any time.
	[ ] The dungeons are completely optional to beating the game and finishing every quest, 
		although there will be a stat called "unique dungeons completed" that would probably have to be maxed out to be considered 100% completion
	[ ] Each floor of the dungeon will have one item, randomized from a list of dungeon-exclusive items (as well as gold and alchemy ingredients)
	[ ] Each floor will have one mini-boss, who upon killing will drop a key that lets you unlock the door to the next floor
	[ ] The final floor will have a true boss that is much stronger than the minibosses and will unlock a stairway to the entrance when defeated.
	[ ] If the player tries to enter the dungeon after completing it, then 
	
[ ] Boss descriptions - A paragraph of text that "sets the scene" for boss battles. Eerie music plays during this time.

[ ] Make it so Potions can be used on allies
		
[ ] Add a second Accessory slot, called an "Action Slot" 
		
[ ] Fix all of the quests that have been broken due to all the above changes
		
[ ] Rewrite the credits, lore, and backstory

[ ] Add back in the Anti-Blood Squad, now that multi-monster battles are a thing.
		
	
-- 1.1 update plans -- 
[ ] Add races (Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, etc)
	[ ] These races would have a slight effect on the players stats
	[ ] Also add a PlayableCharacter.generate_lore() method that generates 2-3 pseudo-random paragraphs based on the player's class and race.
		The lore would be stored in a player_object.lore attribute, and would be viewable from the [P]arty section of the menu.

[ ] Add a neat weather system.
	[ ] Weather has a 5% chance of occuring each time you enter a tile, and
		a 33% chance of stopping when you enter a tile. Tiles that are adjacent to other tiles that already have weather on them will instead have a 
		75% chance to have weather occur. Additionally, tiles that have had a specific whether pattern on it for more than 10 steps will go on "cooldown",
		and be unable to be affected by that whether pattern again for 5 steps. This will (hopefully) result in rare but large "weather islands" occuring.
	[ ] The weather would probably have no gameplay effects, but there could possibly be ascendant abilities that utilize it 
	[ ] Weather ideas
		[ ] Rain (all regions but the desert and tundra) 
		[ ] Snow (the tundra) 
		[ ] Wind (all regions)
		[ ] Sandstorms (desert only)
		
[ ] Random Events in towns:
	[ ] Angry Mobs
	[ ] Monster Attacks
	
[ ] Passive abilities
	[ ] Each class would have one of them. Their affects would occur in every battle without requiring additional input.
